Grocery store 

This Grocery store is a Single Page Application (SPA). Your frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend will communicate with the backend API that built with Ruby and Rails. 
The backend and frontend demonstrate Client-Server Communication.


This grocery store is not fully functional. it only demonstrate how to fetch items from the activerecord in the backend, add and delete items into cart.
